- All routines will be dictated by the current D/M/Y and time of day.
- Each NPC will require an instance in all rooms it may appear in
- Then each time a room is entered, a check will confirm what state/position they should be in
- instance_create vs activate/deactivate needs testing
- Use room_speed to modify timer for each object
- Paths will be determined via individual mp_grids
- Each NPC with a routine will have its own mp_grid containing all other NPCs
- Each time it enters a new cell on its grid it will check for collisions
- If one is found it will plan out a new path
- The game will essentially pause when enterting dialogue (Every object apart from dialogue partner)
