- Once the state of an object changes (routine state) start a timer in an independant object (routineManager)
- When the player enters the appropriate room, start the path for the object at the point - path_position = timer/path_length
- If the entire timer expires, move the object onto its next relative state and start a new timer
- Continue this method for all object states in order to create routines
- During special events certain routine states will change
